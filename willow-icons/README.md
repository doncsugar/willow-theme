# Icons
Willow aims for full folder compatibilty with Papirus. There are about 30 unique icons in total. To be pixel perfect, Willow needs one for each scale (e.g. 16, 22, 32, 48, 64).
## Contributing
Want to help Willow? The easiest thing you can do is make overlays for folders. See the [locked](icon-pipeline/places/special-folder-assets/overlays/locked) icon scales to see the format. Just take bare folder icons from [generic-folder](icon-pipeline/places/generic-folder/icons) and draw the shapes over them. Don't worry too much about formatting the SVGs properly, I will clean them up before adding them.
